    <h2>Program</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Write a HTML program to design basic html structure with following parameters.</strong> <br> <br>
      <strong>Title:</strong> Basic HTML <br>
      <strong>Heading:</strong> A Social Media Platform<br>
      <strong>Website Topic Name: </strong><u>Sociama</u> <br> <br>
      <!-- <strong>Paragraph:</strong> <br> -->
      <strong>Description of Website:</strong> <br>
    <p>
      It is social networking website that allows registered users to create profiles, upload photos and video, send messages and keep in touch with friends, family and colleagues. <br>
      In this project we will design a web application in which the user need to first register with there email-id or phone-number. After that user need’s to fill there information like personal information, education details, etc. After filling this information user will share there photo’s, video’s etc.<br><br>
      <strong>Public features such as:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Groups - allows members who have common interests to find each other and interact.</li>
        <li>Events - allows members to publicize an event, invite guests and track who plans to attend.</li>
        <li>Pages - allows members to create and promote a public page built around a specific topic.</li>
        <li>Presence technology - allows members to see which contacts are online and chat in Real Time.</li>
      </ul>

      <strong>For privacy:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>A member can make all his communications visible to everyone, he can block specific connections or he can keep all his communications private.</li>
        <li>Using the search facilities, members can locate other Facebook members and "friend" them by sending them an invitation, or they can invite people to join Facebook.</li>
        <li>The News Feed shows the activity of the people and organizations members follow, while very active members see updates in real-time on their NewsFeed.</li>
        <li>There are three types of representation on our platform ie. Individuals create a Facebook "Profile," which is normally a two-way interaction with friends. Businesses create a Facebook "Page" to promote products and brands. Also called a "Fan
        Page," all members are accepted as fans, and although comments can be posted by them, a Page is primarily a one-way broadcast from the business. (<em>In our case, Business and fan pages are to be on hold for a initial phase of project</em>)</li>
      </ul>
